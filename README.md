# NvGigaChad Install
Install scripts for Neovim using my custom NvChad configuration. Supports Linux/Unix and MacOS.

gcc, g++, unzip, python, pip, and npm must be installed for all plugins and language servers to install successfully. [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) environments are required for the associated plugins to function. 

Install with ```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://git.windsweptgames.com/NvGigaChad/installer/raw/branch/main/install.sh)"```
or alternatively 
Install from github with ```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WindsweptGames/NvGigaChad/main/install.sh) github"```
