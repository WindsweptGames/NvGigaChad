# nvchad-install
Install scripts for Neovim using my custom NvChad configuration.

You will need to have gcc, g++, unzip, python, and pip installed for all plugins to install successfully. Go and Rust environments and langauge servers (gospl, rsl) are required for the associated plugins to function. 

Setup [Go][https://go.dev/doc/install] and [Rust][https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install].

Run with ```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aWindsweptEmu/nvchad-install/main/install.sh)"```
